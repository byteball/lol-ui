			content="LOL is a price-protected token on top of LINE, which was the first price-protected token. If LOL price in terms of LINE grows, you can book a profit. If it falls, you can get your collateral back (less fees). You are always above a certain line. You can bridge LOL to Obyte and earn about 7% APY from Kava Rise."
